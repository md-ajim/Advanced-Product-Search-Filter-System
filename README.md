# 🛒 Product Filter & Search App

A full-stack e-commerce filtering system built to showcase high-performance, scalable design using **Django REST Framework** on the backend and **Next.js (App Router)** on the frontend. This project demonstrates a production-ready architecture with modern UI/UX, advanced filtering, and seamless user interaction.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- **Dynamic Product Filtering:**  
  Users can filter products by category, price range, and customer rating — all without page reloads.

- **Live Search Functionality:**  
  Real-time search lets users quickly find products by name, description, or attributes.

- **Advanced Sorting Options:**  
  Products can be sorted by price and creation date, giving users control over how they browse the catalog.

- **Collapsible & Responsive UI Components:**  
  Built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a beautiful, mobile-friendly user experience.

✅ Designed with recruiter and product owner expectations in mind  
✅ Focuses on **real-world use cases** like product discovery and dynamic content updates  
✅ Built with industry-standard tools used in professional production apps  
✅ Clean separation of concerns — backend logic, filtering, and UI are all modular and scalable  
✅ Responsive, accessible, and built to convert users
